# PixmanBuilder

[![Build Status](https://gitlab.com/BinaryBuilder.jl/PixmanBuilder/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/BinaryBuilder.jl/PixmanBuilder/pipelines)

This is a builder repository for [Pixman](http://www.pixman.org/). Using a combination of [`BinaryBuilder.jl`](https://github.com/staticfloat/BinaryBuilder.jl), [Gitlab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/), and [GitHub releases](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases/), we are able to create a fully-automated, github-hosted binary building and serving infrastructure.
